Code and data for the paper "Exploiting Biased Models to De-bias Text: A Gender-Fair Rewriting Model"


## Reproducing Results

We release the source and target files for our automatic evaluations as well as all model outputs in the `automatic_evaluation/data` folder. The files are named as in Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper.

To compute the WER, call the following script with the corresponding paths to the HYPOTHESIS and REFERENCE files:

    python automatic_evaluation/evaluate.py -r REFERENCE -h1 HYPOTHESIS

To compare two models and compute statistical significance, call the script like this:

    python automatic_evaluation/evaluate.py -r REFERENCE -h1 HYPOTHESIS_1 -h2 HYPOTHESIS_2
